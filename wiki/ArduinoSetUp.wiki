#summary Do the wiring and setup of the Arduino and the Remote Control
#labels Featured

This is the most challenging part, because you have to wire-up some hardware and use the Arduino IDE.

==1. Prepare the remote==

To send the signals to the remote plugs, we use the original remotes SAW-Module (the transmitter). Therefore the remote needs to be opened.

  * Scrape up the trace pointing to the transmitter
  * Solder a piece of wire onto the trace

==2. Connect Remote to Arduino==

TODO check the port in the arduino script

==3. Connect Temp Sensors==

TODO manual

==4. Install Arduino Software==

  * pins
  * display 
  * temp sensors

==5. Connect to Raspberry==

  Simply connect via USB :)
